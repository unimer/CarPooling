<p> The problem of finding transport that suits your budget and time can be
tricky. You won't be able to find transport every single time you need to go
somewhere. Busses and trains have a tight schedule and you have to adjust to it.
Luckily, there is another type of travel that is more adjustable, friendly and
faster. Carpooling is a very effective way of traveling. It allows more people to
use one vehicle, in such a way that it reduces each personâ€™s travel costs.
Carpooling is also a good way to reduce air pollutions, traffic jams and lack of
parking spaces. Because of that, from now, there will be such a web application which
allows users to share their journeys and their contact information where other
people can see it, to reach a common destination. <p>

<p>Our project is supposed to help all those who need to find an appropriate
transportation.</p>
